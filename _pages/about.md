I am a researcher and lecturer at the Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, where I explore the intersection of artificial intelligence, education, and psychology. My research focuses on adaptive learning technologies, algorithms for mental health risk detection and intervention, and human-in-the-loop learning.

My work draws on diverse methods, including natural language processing, generative AI, and reinforcement learning, with a focus on explainable AI, interactive systems, and ethical design. I have contributed to international research projects on diversity-aware incentive design, human-AI collaboration, and intelligent support systems in educational and psychological contexts.

Before joining academia, I gained extensive experience in the high-tech sector, bringing a practical perspective that complements my academic research. I am always happy to connect and collaborate â€” feel free to reach out.
